	\section*{My inspiration}
		\hspace{.5 in}For my project I want to be able to write a program that will take equations such as $ d = v_0 * t + \frac{a* t^2}{2}$ and be able to solve them with any information the user is given. 
		
	\section*{Objective}
		\hspace*{.5 in}To create a program that will take physics equations known as kinematics equations and based on the input the user has it will solve for any unknown variable. I will also need to provide concepts such as gravity that are a constant value.
	
	\section*{Timeline}
		\hspace*{.5 in}From a realistic stand point I expect this project to take me a few weeks, since I only really have common knowledge about Java, however if I work hard and everyday I will not only get this program to work but I will also have expanded my knowledge in the field of programming.
	
	\section*{Project Significance}
		\hspace*{.5 in}This would be a significant project, because not only would it be a major help in checking ones work, but it will also allow me to get to know programming better, and open my mind to new learning possibilities.

	\section*{Personal Project Importance}
		This is important to me because:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It allows me to get familiar with a programming language
			\item Allow me to gain useful programming skills
			\item Act as a guide that will pave the way for my future
		\end{itemize}

	\section*{Learning Outcome}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Gain knowledge on how Java works
			\item Understand concepts such as 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Arrays
					\item Files
					\item Scanners
					\item Recursive Functions
				\end{itemize}
			\item Gain experience in Java programming
		\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Research or Added Help}
		\hspace*{.5 in}I plan to use outside resources such as YouTube \& Google to help me get a better understanding for what I want to do, and to help me if I get stuck at any point. \\
		\hspace*{.5 in}I also plan on asking the people here at UTEP for help and guidance as I progress with this project.
