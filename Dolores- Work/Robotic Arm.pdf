		\subsection{Signifcance to El Paso}
			\hspace*{.5 in}It helps globally by causing more people to use their arms even if they are robotic arms. When people have robotic arms they do alot more than they used to before they had gotten the robotic arm. Robotic arms can be a good thing but it can also be a bad thing.\\
			\hspace*{.5 in}Robotic arms can be a good thing because it can help people wh have the robotic arm to do alot more things that they want to do. It can also be a bad thing because people can use it to do something really bad.

	\section*{Project Timeline}
		\hspace{.5 in}I expect that robotic arms can help alot of people through almost everything. I believe that most people can use robotic arms to do more things on their own but they might want other people to help them.\\
	\section*{Information}
		\hspace*{.5 in}Robotic arms sends signals to your brain to let your brain know that you are using that arm for something. You can also feel things using the robotic arm.
	\section*{Compare for Insperation}
