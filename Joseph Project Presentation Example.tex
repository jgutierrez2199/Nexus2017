		\begin{frame}{A note on Web Scrapers}
			A web scraper is any program that is used to get info off of internet\\
			There are also forms of web scrapers called web crawlers used to check that links are all working and stuff on big sites. \\
			These kinds of programs are also the reason that we have captchas
